## Plugin Overview

This is a plugin developed for the RotorHazard timing system with cooperation with MultiGP. It allows for the ability to pull and push data through the MultiGP API to assist with event management.

This plugin now comes packaged with a mini version of [FPVScores](https://github.com/FPVScores/FPVScores) allowing you to push your event results without the need to install the full version.

- RotorHazard v4.1+ is required to run this plugin
   - Stricter RotorHazard version requirements are enforced for running Global Qualifers
- You will need your MultiGP Chapter's API key
- An internet connection when pushing or pulling data from MultiGP

> [!NOTE]
> An internet connection is not required for running the event, unless ZippyQ is being used
