.. warning::

   Please be aware that this plugin is not currently approved for MultiGP Global Qualifers, but the RotorHazard development team is currently in communication with MultiGP to potentially make this a future capability for the upcoming 2024 Global Qualifers season.

This is a plugin developed for the RotorHazard timing system. It allows for the ability to pull and push data through the MultiGP API to assist with event management.

This plugin comes packaged with a mini version of `FPVScores plugin <https://github.com/FPVScores/FPVScores>`_ allowing you to push your event results without the need to install the full version.
