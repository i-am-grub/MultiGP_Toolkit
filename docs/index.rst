This is a plugin developed for the RotorHazard timing system with cooperation with MultiGP. It allows for the ability to pull and push data through the MultiGP API to assist with event management.

This plugin comes packaged with a mini version of `FPVScores plugin <https://github.com/FPVScores/FPVScores>`_ allowing you to push your event results without the need to install the full version.
