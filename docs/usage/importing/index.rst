Waiting for Plugin Activation
-------------------------------------------

After placing your MultiGP chapter's timer API key into the RotorHazard system,
the plugin will activate if the timer has an internet connection after rebooting.
The server will wait for a duration of time before checking the internet to give the
timer the some extra time to establish the connection.

Archiving any Previous Events
-------------------------------------------

Before importing a new event, it is best practice to archive your previous event. To archive
your previous event start by locating the ``Event`` panel.

1. Open up the ``Event`` panel and then click ``Archive/New Event``

Import a MultiGP Event
-------------------------------------------

1. Locate the ``MultiGP Race Import`` panel. The panel will include the name of the MultiGP chapter 
associated with the entered MultiGP API key.

.. tip::

        Turn on ``Download Logo`` to download the chapter's logo to the timer. It will automatically
        be added to your timer's home page.

After importing, your race's name and description should be visable under the ``Event`` panel,
pilots imported under the ``Pilots`` panel, and a Class setup under the ``Classes and Heats`` panel.
