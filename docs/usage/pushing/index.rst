.. note::

    The use of this setting will require you to select a race that does **NOT** use the ``From Race Format`` 
    setting, otherwise, it will be skipped and MultiGP will automatically calculate the rankings based
    on the race format.

FPVScores Settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are two FPVScores related settings under the ``MultiGP Results Controls`` panels. The first setting
will either activate or deactivate the ability to push Results to FPVScores.

The second setting allows you to provide a FPVScores Event UUID to allow you to push your results
to a specific FPVScores event. See the table showing the mapped functionality of the :ref:`MultiGP 
Toolkit's Ability to Upload to FPVScores <fpvscores table>`.
