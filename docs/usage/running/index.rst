Running Races
===========================================

This section is for assisting Race Directors with running
their races with the MultiGP Toolkit installed on a RotorHazard system

Enforced Rules
-------------------------------------------

When the MultiGP Toolkit is install on a RotorHazard system there are a
certain set of rules it enforces to ensure that the results generated
by the system are capable of being uploaded to MultiGP reliably.

All Races
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The follow rules will be enforced by the system for any race ran with
the plugin installed. This **INCLUDES** any races under classes and heats
that were manually created.
    
- A pilot is only allowed to occupy one slot per heat

Controlled Races
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The follow rules may be enforced by the system for any race ran with
the plugin installed **INCLUDING** any races under classes and heats
that were manually created, but **EXCLUDING** any classes that were creating
by importing a ZippyQ race.
    
- Each heat within a class must advance to the max round currently in the class before any class currently at the highest round can advance.
    
.. admonition:: Example

    Heat 1 has completed 3 rounds, Heat 2 has completed
    2 rounds, and Heat 3 has completed 2 rounds. 
    
    Heat 1 cannot run a 4th round until Heat 2 **and** Heat 3 have
    completed 3 rounds.

- Each pilot will only be able to participate in one heat per class

.. note::

    This rule is not enforced due to situations where a minimum
    of pilots per heat is enforced. Instead, a notification will be
    produced by the system warning about how a pilot's MultiGP result 
    for a given round (on MultiGP's side) will be obtained by the last heat 
    they participate in that round (on RotorHazard's side).


ZippyQ Races
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The follow rules will be enforced by the system for a race belonging to
a class that was generated by importing a ZippyQ race.

- ZippyQ rounds must be ran in the order in which they were created
- Completed ZippyQ rounds cannot be repeated.

.. _gq rules:

Global Qualifiers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The follow rules will be enforced by the system for a race belonging to
a class that was imported as a Global Qualifier (Controlled or ZippyQ).

- An approved version RotorHazard and the MultiGP Toolkit must be used for running Global Qualifiers. This includes the primary RotorHazard codebase as well as the MultiGP Toolkit's codebase.

.. seealso::

    :ref:`Software version requirements for Global Qualifiers <gq versions>`.

.. note::

    The MultiGP Toolkit contains a system to notify the
    race director when a mandatory update is available for 
    either RotorHazard or the MultiGP Toolkit

- A minimum of 3 pilots are required per heat
- The imported class from MultiGP can not be altered and must be used for the Global Qualifier event (results will not be uploaded otherwise)
- The format assigned to the imported class from MultiGP cannot be altered with exception to the settings that manage the start/stop behavior of the timer
- Other plugins can not be used to register laps

ReRunning Races
-------------------------------------------

In the event a race needs to be rerun, you should ``Stop`` the race and then ``Discard Laps``. This will prevent the race results from being saved
into the internal database. Once the results are saved into the database, they can not be deleted.

1. Stop the Race

2. Discard Laps

Move Race Results
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the event that the results were saved to the internal database and the race needs to be rerun, you will need to reassign the results to
another heat to prevent the race data from being associated with your MultiGP event.

1. Navigate to the ``Format`` page 
2. Locate the ``Classes and Heats`` panel 
3. Add a new Class
4. Add a new Heat to the class

5. Navigate to the ``Marshal`` page 
6. Select the Heat and Round you would like to reassing
7. Select the Heat you would like to reassign the race data to and click ``Reassign Heat``
