Activating the MultiGP Toolkit
===========================================

In order to activate most of the MultiGP Toolkit's functionality, your MultiGP chapter's timer API key must 
be provided.

1. Navigate to the ``Settings`` page within RotorHazard

2. Open the ``MultiGP Credentials`` panel

3. Enter your timer's API key

.. note::

    After inputting your API key, make sure to click somewhere outside of the entry's text box. RotorHazard's 
    internal database will not register the entry otherwise

4. Reboot the RotorHazard server.

After inputting a valid MultiGP API key, anytime the timer is rebooted and a internet connection is detected
at startup, there will be additional functionality added to the RotorHazard UI. See `Importing a Event into 
RotorHazard <importing from mgp>` for an example of this additional functionality.
