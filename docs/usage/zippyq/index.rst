Import ZippyQ Rounds
------------------------------

After importing a race with ZippyQ enabled, a new Class under ``Classes and Heats`` will
be created. This class will not have any heats under it.

*Optional:* Turn on ``Use Automatic ZippyQ Import``. This feature will automatically download the next
ZippyQ round when the race for the previous one has finished instead of needing to click the ``Import Next ZippyQ Round``
after every round.

*Optional:* Turn on ``Active Race on Import``. This feature will automatically set the next round as the
active race after downloading either manually or automatically. This feature will trigger the ``Heat Change``
event within RotorHazard.
